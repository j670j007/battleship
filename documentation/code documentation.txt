This project uses pygame to create a Battleship game. 
It contains a start screen that takes the player to a screen to input how many ships will be used in the game
Based on this, the program will give each player the specified number of ships to place on the board
The program then alternates between each player, giving them a chance to place their ships
Once the ships are placed, the program alternates between giving each player a chance to attack, tells them if it miss or hit, and then switches to the next player
This loop continues until one player wins
